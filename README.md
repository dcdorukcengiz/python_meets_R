# python_meets_R
A set of simple data wrangling interview questions. The questions are as follows:  
1-) Could you export the data and replace NA values in Quantity column with 0?  
2-) Could you aggregate data by State AND MonthBucket using SUM of quantities as aggregation? *Python warning: State and MonthBucket should remain as separate columns in the data.*  
3-) Assume that later on, you have another dataset with different information (say, order information). Could you join this data with the previous data?  
4-) Say, you have built a forecast model, and you get the following forecasts at state-by-month-level. Could you pivot this data from long to wide format? Each row will show the state information. *Python warning: State should remain as a separate column in the data.*
